                    <h1>Reflection</h1>
                    <p> Given that this project was taken to the final stage of development, it's appropriate to reflect on the deisgn process involved and the next steps.<br><br>

                    <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-user-interviews.html" target="_blank">User requirements</a> were gathered by carrying out interviews with a range of different potential users. In retrospect, it would have been beneficial to also create various Personas in order to understand the needs of a larger variety of users; and to be better able to empathize with them throughout the design process. <br><br>

                    <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-task-analysis.html" target="_blank">Task analysis</a>  was then carried out was done using the results from <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-user-interviews.html" target="_blank">user interviews</a>. This led to the idea of having 2 seperate pages, one to deal with ad performance, and one for AB testing. Looking back, the task analysis could have been refined to be more granular in order to better flush out the functionalities required. <br><br>

                     In keeping with the main takeaways from the <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-user-interviews.html" target="_blank"> user interviews </a> and <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-task-analysis.html" target="_blank"> task analysis </a> a basic <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-navigation.html" target="_blank">navigation</a> prototype was made to allow users to access the performance of their ads, manage the set of active ads, and run AB tests using the top bar. A filter tool implemented across each of the pages will allow users to filter between multiple criteria such as dates, and ad campaigns. This navigation prototype could have been improved by exploring other forms of navigation such as left oriented navigation instead of the top bar. <br><br>


                     Several <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-mood_boards.html" target="_blank">mood boards</a> were created to explore different themes that could be incorporated into the final design. These could have been improved through the addition of different fonts as well as a broader variety of images.<br><br> 

                     Next, <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-wire_frames.html" target="_blank"> wireframes</a> for each main page were created. The wireframes could have been improved by incorporating the prototypes of the charts that were going to be used, as they are a key part of the user experience. The interaction of information between the graphs is also very important, as we have to make sure users are able to quickly get all of the information they need the most. The <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-icons.html" target="_blank">icons</a> used in these wireframes could also be replaced by text as they do not add enough value to justify the amount of space they take on the screen.<br><br>


                     An initial <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-prototype.html" target="_blank">prototype</a> was made and then revised using feedback from users to create a <a href="page-title-pattern-fydp-refinement.html" target="_blank">refined design</a>. The refined design could have been further improved through the use of a usability scale survey.
